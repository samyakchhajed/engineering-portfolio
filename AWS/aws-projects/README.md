# AWS Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my work and experiments related to **AWS systems, cloud computing, and architecture design**.

The focus of this repository is on:

* understanding how AWS services behave in real systems
* making deliberate architectural and compute decisions
* exploring trade-offs between different design approaches
* building solutions with clear constraints around cost, lifecycle, and reliability

The contents of this repository may include:

* cloud experiments
* system design explorations
* automation workflows
* architectural prototypes
* learning-driven implementations

There is **no fixed pattern or single type of solution** here.
Each addition represents a specific problem explored at a specific point in time.

This repository is intended to **evolve over time** as my understanding of AWS and cloud systems grows.
