AWS_CLEANER.PY — OPERATOR NOTES
===============================

PURPOSE
-------
aws_cleaner.py is a read-only hygiene and reasoning tool designed to analyze AWS resources more deeply than a standard health check. It adds time-based context to help identify resources that may have been forgotten or are no longer serving an intentional purpose.

This tool is designed for:
- Identifying "zombie" resources (stopped EC2s, empty S3 buckets) 
- Highlighting hygiene risks like missing CloudWatch log retention 
- Providing age-based signals to inform manual cleanup decisions 
- Reducing mental load by answering: “Is this still intentional?” 

This tool is NOT for:
- Deleting, stopping, or modifying resources 
- Calculating costs or making automated decisions 
- Replacing manager scripts (S3/EC2) or the AWS Console 


OPERATING PHILOSOPHY
--------------------
- Reasoning over Reporting: It provides "signals," not just raw data 
- Strictly Read-Only: No destructive or mutative actions are implemented 
- Age-Based Context: Focuses on how long a resource has existed or been idle
- Complements, doesn't duplicate: Goes deeper than aws_health_check.py 

Analysis should lead to human-driven intent, not blind automation.


AWS CONTEXT
-----------
- Uses explicit AWS profile: phase1 
- Uses AWS SDK (boto3) for resource metadata retrieval
- Enforces service-specific thresholds to flag "old" or "forgotten" items


HYGIENE THRESHOLDS (CONFIGURABLE)
---------------------------------
- EC2: 2 Days (Aggressive; EC2 should be treated as disposable)
- S3: 30 Days (Moderate; allows for project lifecycle survival)
- CloudWatch: 7 Days (Weekly; ensures retention policies are applied)


REASONING SIGNALS EXPLAINED
---------------------------

EC2 SIGNALS
- OK: Running or Stopped within the threshold
- DISCIPLINE ALERT: Running longer than the threshold (Potential cost leak)
- COST RISK: Stopped longer than the threshold (Consuming EBS storage unnecessarily)

S3 SIGNALS
- OK: Contains data or is newly created
- IDLE: Empty but created within the threshold
- ABANDONED: Empty and older than the threshold (High confidence for deletion)

CLOUDWATCH SIGNALS
- OK: Specific retention period is set
- HYGIENE RISK: "Never Expire" (Logs will grow indefinitely, increasing costs)


WHAT THIS SCRIPT WILL NEVER DO
------------------------------
- Delete or terminate any resource 
- Automatically empty buckets or remove logs 
- Guess user intent without providing the data first 
- Run on a schedule or as a background daemon 


WHEN TO ACT ON CLEANER SIGNALS
------------------------------
The output of aws_cleaner.py is a signal for review. Use your manager scripts to act when:
- Multiple regions are being used and resources are drifting 
- Long gaps occur between AWS usage sessions 
- You no longer remember the specific intent of a resource
- Costs or hygiene risks are highlighted as "High" or "Risk"


FINAL NOTE
----------
This tool prioritizes memory and reasoning over speed. If a resource is flagged, it is an engineering decision to decide whether to keep it or use the appropriate manager script to remove it.
