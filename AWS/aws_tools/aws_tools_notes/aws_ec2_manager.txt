EC2_MANAGER.PY — OPERATOR NOTES
==============================

PURPOSE
-------
aws_ec2_manager.py is a safe, CLI-based EC2 operator tool. It is designed to replace routine EC2 console usage (start, stop, reboot, terminate) while enforcing strong safety guardrails and explicit user intent.

This tool is NOT for:
- Creating EC2 instances
- Designing infrastructure
- Changing networking, security groups, or IAM
Those are design-time decisions and should be done via AWS Console or IaC.

This tool IS for:
- Observing EC2 state
- Operating existing EC2 instances deliberately and safely


OPERATING PHILOSOPHY
--------------------
- Read first, act later
- No hidden defaults
- No silent actions
- No batch destructive operations
- Human-in-the-loop confirmations for all mutations
- Heavy confirmation for irreversible actions

The script is safer than the AWS Console for day-to-day EC2 operations.


AWS CONTEXT (IMPORTANT)
-----------------------
- Uses explicit AWS profile: phase1
- Uses explicit AWS region (configured in the script)
- Never relies on default credentials
- Always prints profile and region at startup

Always verify profile and region printed at the top before performing any action.


PHASES OVERVIEW
---------------

PHASE A — READ-ONLY (DEFAULT)
-----------------------------
Command: python <path_to>aws_ec2_manager.py

What it does:
- Lists ALL EC2 instances in the configured account & region
- Displays key metadata for each instance
- Makes NO changes to AWS

Displayed fields:
- Instance ID
- Name tag (or N/A)
- State (running / stopped / etc.)
- Instance type
- Public IP (if any)
- Availability Zone
- Launch time

Summary footer:
- Total instance count
- Running instance count
- Stopped instance count

Use this phase when:
- You want visibility
- You want to avoid opening the AWS Console
- You want to check state before any action

This phase is always safe to run.


PHASE B — SAFE ACTIONS
----------------------
Supported actions:
- start
- stop
- reboot

Command format: python <path_to>aws_ec2_manager.py <start|stop|reboot> <instance-id>

Behavior:
- Validates instance exists
- Validates current state (e.g., won’t stop a stopped instance)
- Displays instance details
- Requires explicit YES confirmation
- Performs action on ONE instance only
- Prints clear success or failure message

This phase is reversible and safe when used correctly.


PHASE C — HIGH-RISK ACTION (TERMINATE)
-------------------------------------
Supported action: 
- terminate

Command format: python <path_to>aws_ec2_manager.py terminate <instance-id>

IMPORTANT:
- Termination is IRREVERSIBLE
- This permanently deletes the EC2 instance
- Attached root volumes may also be deleted

Heavy confirmation flow:
- Displays strong warning banner
- Prints instance ID, name, state, type, AZ, launch time
- Requires typing EXACTLY: TERMINATE <instance-id>
- Any mismatch cancels the action
- No shortcuts (YES is NOT accepted)

Never terminate an instance unless you are 100% sure.


WHAT THIS SCRIPT WILL NEVER DO
------------------------------
- Create EC2 instances
- Modify security groups
- Modify VPC or networking
- Resize instances
- Perform batch operations
- Act without confirmation
- Run in background or on a schedule

This is an operator tool, not an automation daemon.


ERROR HANDLING
--------------
- Errors are loud and explicit
- Script exits immediately on fatal issues
- No partial or silent failures
- If AWS credentials/profile are invalid, nothing runs

If something fails:
- Read the message
- No AWS state is changed unless explicitly confirmed


WHEN TO USE AWS CONSOLE INSTEAD
-------------------------------
Use AWS Console when:
- Creating a new EC2 instance
- Designing networking or security
- Choosing AMIs and storage
- Exploring unfamiliar settings

Use aws_ec2_manager.py when:
- Managing existing instances
- Avoiding repetitive clicks
- Wanting safer, more deliberate control


FINAL NOTE
----------
This tool is intentionally conservative. Friction and confirmations are features, not bugs. Trust is more important than speed.
