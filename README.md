## Engineering Portfolio

This repository serves as a **single, structured portfolio** of my work across cloud, automation, and applied engineering.

The goal of this repository is **clarity over volume**:

* Clear separation between learning, tools, and projects
* No inflated or placeholder work
* A structure that scales over time without refactoring

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized **by domain**, and within each domain by **maturity level**.

```
AWS/        → Active work (current focus)
Python/     → Planned next phase
AI-ML/      → Planned
Azure/      → Planned
GCP/        → Planned
```

Each cloud or language domain follows the same internal pattern:

* **learning-projects** → concept isolation and fundamentals
* **tools** → reusable, safety-focused utilities
* **projects** → higher-level systems and integrations

This separation is intentional and maintained consistently.

## Current Focus

### AWS (Active)

AWS is the current focus area.
The `AWS/` folder contains **real, completed work**, including:

* Learning-focused experiments
* Operator-grade tooling
* Structured AWS projects

See `AWS/README.md` for detailed explanation.

---

## Planned Roadmap

The following folders exist intentionally but are **not populated yet**:

* **Python** → automation + foundations (next phase)
* **AI / ML** → applied ML along with Python foundations (next phase)
* **Azure & GCP** → cloud expansion after ~1 year

Empty folders are deliberate and avoid misrepresenting unfinished work.

## How to Review This Repository

If you are short on time:

1. Start with **AWS/**
2. Read `AWS/README.md`
3. Focus on:

   * `aws-tools/`
   * `aws-projects/` 
   * `aws-learning-projects/`

---

## Engineering Philosophy

* Safety before speed
* Explicit intent over convenience
* Clean structure over clever hacks
* Low-maintenance systems that scale over time

This repository reflects how I think about **building systems**, not just writing code.
